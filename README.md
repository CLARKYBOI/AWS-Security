# 🛡️ AWS-Security
This portfolio will be documentation of my AWS learning and using it as a textbook!
### 👤 Account creation

I started with securely provisioning and hardening my AWS account
- Enabled MFA on the AWS root account, Then created a non-root IAM administrator user for my day-to-day use
- Assigned IAM users to permission-scoped IAM groups representing employee job functions, enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)


## 🗂️Projects
[AWS Web Application](#diagram)
This was a simple Web Application integrating AWS services - **Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, and DynamoDB** - to build a functional web application from scratch.
Its use was to familize my self with common AWS services and allow my self to experiece building an application.

🧠**Thought process**
-----
**1.** Needs a way to create/host a webpage    
**2.** Needs a way to invoke a Python functionality  
**3.** Needs a way to run code  
**4.** Needs a place to store/return output  
**5.** Needs a way to handle permission  

💡 Solutions
-----
**1.** **Amplify** can be used to build and host websites. (For simplicity, a text editor was used to create an index.html page)  


**2.** **API Gateway** can be used to build a REST API to invoke the Lambda function.  


**3.** **Lambda** running Python code serverlessly upon some trigger. (In this case, it was user input)  


**4.** **DynamoDB** used a key-value ("NoSQL") database. (This wasn't needed because I could have returned the value, and there was no need to store; however, for learning purposes I added it in)  


**5.** **IAM** is needed to set permissions on the execution role for Lambda

## Quick Documentation / Note
## **Please Disregard below**

CLI command to change username - **aws iam update-user --user-name NAME --new-user-name NEWNAME**
  - User will stay in group but permissions will not transfer and will have to be reassigned to the new name
### Elastic Beanstalk
**Service Role** - IAM role that EB assumes to interact with other AWS services
  - Create EC2 instances, load balancers, Auto Scaling groups

**EC2 Instance Profile** - IAM role attached to the EC2 instance 
  - Giving permissions for applications on those instances to interact with other AWS services
      - Allowing to upload logs to S3, write to an RDS DB and Cloudwatch

### AWS Lambda 
  - Code runs on a server that is not needed to be managed and runs in response to some event

### S3 
 - Object storage storing data within buckets identified by a unique key and supported by metadata
